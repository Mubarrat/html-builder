# HTML Builder

## Overview
The HTML Builder Library is designed to assist in constructing HTML within your JavaScript or TypeScript files, providing a versatile interface for generating dynamic HTML content.

## Purpose
This JavaScript library enables the dynamic creation of HTML elements within your codebase. It offers a flexible and intuitive interface for generating HTML content programmatically.
